> Nodejs test / demo server application

[![Build status][ci-image] ][ci-url]
[![js-standard-style][standard-image] ](http://standardjs.com/)

Example from [howtonode.org/hello-node](http://howtonode.org/hello-node)

```sh
git clone git@github.com:bahmutov/hello-world.git

For example, you can use this project to try
[the Dokku platform](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/running-multiple-applications-in-dokku/)

## Small Docker image

In order to show how to build smaller Docker image, while still testing this app,
see the three Docker files

* [Dockerfile-simple](Dockerfile-simple)
* [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) with multi-stage feature
* [Dockerfile-bare](Dockerfile-bare) based on the smallest Node images without NPM

The images built from these files show the space savings

```
$ docker images gleb/hello-world
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
gleb/hello-world    bare                78cdddcd77ac        23 seconds ago      37.9MB
gleb/hello-world    multi-stage         44dcd42b11f4        17 minutes ago      49.4MB
gleb/hello-world    simple              aed28e2bde45        31 minutes ago      202MB
```
